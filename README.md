Data Science Methodology:
<ul>
  <li>A process that drives activities within a given domain.</li>
  <li>It is the process with defined input to achieve a defined output.</li>
  <li>It consists of various stages that form an iterative process to uncover insights.</li>
  <li>Data scientists need a foundational methodology for providing a business strategy.</li>
</ul>

Business understanding is the first stage of any project.
<ul>
  <li>Business understanding -> Analytic approach</li>
  <li>Questions to think about:
    <ul>
      <li>Who needs the analytical solution?</li>
      <li>What is the business need?</li>
      <li>What is the customer need?</li>
      <li>What are the benefits?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Chosen business understanding
    <ul>
      <li>Defines the problem, project objectives, and solution requirements.</li>
      <li>Lays the foundation for a successful end result.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Chosen analytic approach
    <ul>
      <li>Determines business and data requirements.</li>
      <li>Determines hardware/software, analytical methods, data content, formats, and representations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

From Requirements to Collection
<ul>
  <li>Data requirements -> Data collection
    <ul>
      <li>Data acquisition: the process of digitizing data from the world around us so it can be displayed, analyzed, and stored in a computer.</li>
      <li>Data wrangling: the process of removing errors and combining complex data sets to make them more accessible and easier to analyze.</li>
      <li>Data analysis: the process of systematically applying statistical and/or logical techniques to describe and illustrate, condense and recap, and evaluate data.</li>
      <li>Data modeling: The process of analyzing and defining all the different data your business collects and produces, as well as the relationships between those bits of data.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

From Understanding to Preparation
<ul>
  <li>Data understanding -> Data preparation</li>
  <li>Data understanding
    <ul>
      <li>Use descriptive statistics and visualiation techniques to:
        <ul>
          <li>Know data content.</li>
          <li>Assess data quality.</li>
          <li>Discover initial data insights.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Data preparation
    <ul>
      <li>Dealing with invalid values.</li>
      <li>Eliminating duplicates.</li>
      <li>Formatting data from multiple sources.</li>
      <li>Transforming data into more useful variables.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

From Modeling to Evaluation
<ul>
  <li>Modeling -> Evaluation</li>
  <li>Modeling stage focuses on predictive or descriptive model development.</li>
  <li>Data Scientists use historical data and by applying predictive analysis the outcome is depicted.</li>
  <li>Data scientists try multiple algorithms with respective parameters to determine the best model for the dataset.</li>
  <li>After the model is developed, the model is evaluated for its quality to ensure it addresses teh business problem completely.</li>
  <li>For evaluation, diagnostic measures are computed, outputs are evaluated and data mining is evaluated.</li>
  <li>After evaluating:
    <ul>
      <li>Review the whole evaluation process.</li>
      <li>Highlight activities that are missed.</li>
      <li>Ensure that model is correctly built.</li>
      <li>Identify failures.</li>
      <li>Determine the plan of action based on the findings.</li>
      <li>Analyze and estiate the areas for improvement.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

From Deployment to Feedback
<ul>
  <li>Once the model has been developed, deploy model into the production environment in a limited way.</li>
  <li>Deployment could be:
    <ul>
      <li>Generating a report with recommendations.</li>
      <li>Integrating model with complex workflow.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Once model is deployed, it has to be mined and maintained
    <ul>
      <li>What could change in the environment?</li>
      <li>How to monitor accuracy of the model?</li>
      <li>When to stop using the data mining model?</li>
      <li>Will the business objectives change over time?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Interview employees and users. Summarize reports and the experiences.</li>
</ul>
